## Notes

A challenge that I experienced while creating this app was fixing errors within a class file of the app. In order to tackle this challenge, I read through the tips provided for Lab #2 and read through the error messages that appeared after hovering over the errors. Doing this helped me to gain a better understanding of why the errors were appearing and helped me to fix them.
